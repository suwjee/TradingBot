# TradingBot Bearish Algorithm Reference — Current Standalone Specification

**Document Version:** `5.4.21`  
**Last Modified:** `2026-09-30 13:58:08 +03:30`  
**Status:** `ACTIVE — dominant S-Red continuation / StopAll sequencing correction, byte-exact Source-synchronized`  
**Target Direction:** `bearish`  
**Opposite Direction:** `bullish`  
**Production Source Behavioral Change:** `dominant repeated S-Red continuation cannot be preempted by lower-priority Blue-repeat reversal evidence`  
**Mirror Contract:** Current shared Production Source defines both directional paths. Price geometry is reflected; time, identity, provenance, Doji and lifecycle ordering remain invariant.

> Current Production Source defines executable behavior. This canonical Reference specifies the current audited and synchronized implementation. Section 16 embeds its exact Source bytes.

## 0. Revision scope

This behavioral bug fix preserves the established calculation order `A → S → E → StopAll` and the established cross-stage priority `StopAll > E Red > S Red > E Blue > S Blue > A`. When the active dominant sequence is already `S Red` with accepted occurrence count `>= 2`, a later accepted `S Red` is a continuation of that dominant Red group. Lower-priority pending Blue-repeat evidence may not promote that continuation directly to StopAll. The S Red is retained and counted normally; if the resulting dominant S-Red group later strictly stops at or before an incoming E decision, the existing E-driven `sequence-group-stop` rule may create `StopAll1`. All Blue-lifecycle behavior from `5.4.20` remains unchanged.

## 2. Authoritative pipeline and ownership

The production execution contract is:

`Complete supplied input normalization → both directional Reaction/Reset contexts → cross-direction Internal Reaction classification → Blue → A → initial S → provisional E → S validity/rebuild and accepted A/Order context → final E/OrderAudit → shared physical Order stop reconciliation → consumed-S native continuation → accepted Order_B feedback → lifecycle/StopAll → visibility/lineage closure → final OrderAudit synchronization → serialization`

Order_B and Blue-lifecycle feedback are reconciled together to a deterministic fixed point. Order_B-only changes may reuse unchanged Blue/A/S stages, but any changed accepted `S/E/StopAll` boundary identity forces A/S recalculation with the new immutable Blue-consumption boundary set; Reaction geometry is never recalculated. The full E/StopAll path is bounded to sixteen feedback passes, while the S-only path is bounded to twelve. Repeated identities or pass overflow are explicit non-convergence errors.

The bridge calculates the complete input it actually receives. The full-chart HTTP route supplies the original RAW file. A selected-range HTTP route supplies an in-memory stream filtered by inclusive chart-candle buckets; that calculation begins with empty state at the selected start and cannot use rows outside the supplied stream. Within that supplied input, CLI from/to bounds filter presentation after calculation. Neither frontend nor serialization independently implements trading rules.

Ownership boundaries are strict: Reaction/Reset is owned by `reaction_engine.py`; Blue by `blue_line_detector.py`; A by `a_zone_detector.py`; S by `s_zone_detector.py`; E by `e_zone_detector.py`; physical Order discovery/reuse/provenance by `order_audit_engine.py`; lifecycle/StopAll/visibility by `lifecycle_engine.py`; request/range orchestration and serialization by `bridge/trading_pipeline.py`. Serialization is a projection of finalized state and is not a second trading algorithm.

## 3. Global invariants

1. **Decimal:** every price-sensitive input is normalized with `Decimal(str(value))`; no binary-float decision is authoritative.
2. **Candle color:** `GREEN` iff `close >= open`; `RED` iff `close < open`; a Doji is always GREEN in both market directions.
3. **Strict crossing:** equality never satisfies a strict price crossing. For Bearish behavior-space stops the directional primitive is `High > Level`; the Bullish mirror uses the opposite strict comparator.
4. **Chronology:** exact event ordering comes from the finest selected lower timeframe. Range windows are half-open unless a component explicitly includes a complete main boundary candle. Time is never mirrored.
5. **Reaction identity:** physical Reaction/Order identity is `(FirstIndex, BreakIndex)`. Identity, provenance structure, stable ordering, lifecycle priority, behavior-family names and public schemas are direction-invariant.
6. **Determinism:** candidate ordering and tie-breaking are explicit. Equal main-candle extremes keep the earliest source unless the owning rule explicitly requests last-on-equality (S Type-3/Type-4 candidate construction).
7. **Canonical mirror:** the Bearish Reaction path mechanically reflects the shared Bullish coordinate state machine. Independently inspect explicit directional branches and policies. Reflect prices/roles; preserve time, state ownership, canonical identity, cause structure and lifecycle families.
8. **Calculation vs presentation:** internal/historical objects may remain necessary for later calculation even when they are not independently visible. Final filters cannot rewrite upstream truth.

## 4. Reaction / Reset — ACTIVE Bearish specification

### 4.1 Data and color contract

`Candle` carries `index`, native `timestamp`, display time, immutable market `tag`, and Decimal OHLC. `Candidate` carries First/box sources, Mode A/B, optional anchor and leg boundary, Break, intrabar start, cross-direction gate metadata, public box/number metadata and internal/public ownership flags. `ResetEvent` records main index/time, optional exact lower-TF second, broken level, and the owning Reaction First index.

### 4.2 Canonical directional geometry

For Bearish, the canonical First candle role is **FirstGreen** (`GREEN`) following the opposite context color `RED`. Confirmation is the first strict breakdown satisfying `Low < BoxBottom`. The confirmation edge is `BoxBottom`. The opposite box edge `BoxTop` may evolve only through chronology available up to the exact confirmation event.

The source does not maintain an independent hand-written Bearish state machine: Bearish geometry executes the Bullish reference state machine through exact Decimal sign/High-Low/color-role reflection. Therefore the initial leg, Mode-A invalidation, breakout/breakdown priority, Reset priority, post-confirmation handling, and lower-timeframe tie rules share one mechanical geometry contract. The reflected color role is internal coordinate machinery only; market Doji remains GREEN.

### 4.3 Mode A / leg-start ownership

Mode A is the first Reaction of a leg. The detector establishes the contiguous context run, builds the directional First candidate, preserves any qualifying adjacent anchor, and freezes the outer leg boundary. Before confirmation, strict outer-boundary invalidation owns the candidate ahead of confirmation when lower-TF chronology proves it first. In the standalone initial Mode-A WAITING state, an invalidated owner releases search and nested geometry cannot confirm while its selected structural owner remains unresolved. The bounded Unified post-Reset search has the separate completion-selection contract in Section 4.7.

### 4.4 Mode B / normal ownership

After a confirmed Reaction, normal search uses the running directional context and the required First color. A confirmation main candle may itself seed the next Mode-B First only when the post-confirmation remainder does not first Reset the just-confirmed structure. The complete confirmation candle can be the next First when its market color has the required role; post-event chronology still controls which prices are eligible for the new boundary.

### 4.5 Exact confirmation and published box

If the Break main candle owns the full-main-candle opposite extreme, only lower-TF prices at or before the first strict confirmation may define the published opposite edge. Later prices in that same main candle cannot retroactively alter Reaction/Order geometry. If lower-TF chronology cannot prove a refinement, detector geometry is retained rather than guessed. Equal eligible extremes retain the earliest main-candle owner.

### 4.6 Reset

A confirmed Bearish Reaction resets only on the first strict `High > confirmed BoxTop` event. Equality is not Reset. When Reset and confirmation/break activity share a main candle, selected lower-TF ordering decides which event owns the state transition. Reset reopens **same-direction** Reaction ownership; opposite-direction patterns do not gate that search. A Reset event with an exact lower-TF second exposes that exact second; otherwise the owning main-candle start is the fallback representation.

### 4.7 Post-Reset structural owner vs geometry-only evidence

After Reset, `_first_direct_same_direction_after_reset` scans eligible First candidates in chronological First-index order within the configured end index. It returns a candidate only if confirmation wins before strict loss of its frozen owning boundary. If invalidation wins first, candidates with First indexes at or before that invalidation main index are blocked. A candidate unfinished at the bounded end is skipped, so a later eligible candidate that completes healthily may be returned. The standalone initial Mode-A WAITING state retains its selected unfinished structural owner. The returned healthy result joins the canonical same-direction Reaction stream. `_first_geometry_after_reset` separately returns complete geometry without lifecycle acceptance; geometry alone cannot create Order_A.

### 4.8 Internal Reaction ownership

Cross-direction internal protection is determined after both directions exist. A candidate is internal only when its temporal/box structure is contained by a healthy opposite Reaction and the complete lower-timeframe physical path through its confirmation remains inside the protecting box. Internal identity affects behavior/public ownership; it does not delete historical calculation evidence or renumber the canonical Reaction stream.

## 5. Blue — ACTIVE Bearish specification

### 5.1 Inputs and reference level

Blue consumes canonical Bearish Reactions and Bearish Resets. For each Reaction, the scale reference is the Mode-A boundary when present; otherwise it is the previous Reaction opposite edge. The 0.618 level is `BoxBottom + 0.618 × (reference − BoxBottom)`.

### 5.2 Scale strikes

Within Reaction First..Break inclusive, a new strike requires a strictly higher `High` than the previous confirmed strike (or than the Fibonacci level for the first strike). Pending strikes confirm on a `RED` main candle. A pending strike reaching the Break candle may confirm intrabar only from lower-TF chronology through the strict Reaction confirmation lower-timeframe row, inclusive; the decisive extreme is the most directional eligible lower-TF extreme.

A Scale Blue is emitted when strike count increases and spacing ownership permits it (first Blue, or at least one healthy Reaction since the previous Blue). Its source is the decisive strike; line price is `High − (High − Low) / 3` and its drawing interval is one timeframe before/after the source time.

### 5.3 Reset Blue and double-stop calculation validity

A Reset Blue is sourced by the Reset main candle, with source extreme `High`, broken level from Reset, and line price `High − (High − Low) / 5`. If the prior Blue first strict-stops on that same Reset candle and the Reset source extends strictly farther in the Bearish direction than the prior Blue source extreme, the new Reset Blue is marked `calculation_valid=False`. That invalid line remains calculation evidence for the A double-stop route but is excluded from public Blue output.

### 5.4 Internal/public Blue

A Blue becomes behavior-internal when its owning Reaction is internal, or when both the source extreme and rendered line price lie strictly inside the same protected healthy Reaction. Drawing offset alone does not create internal ownership. Before final behavior ownership, a public Blue requires `calculation_valid and not behavior_internal`. Final source ownership then removes any same-source Blue whose candle is an accepted `S`, `E`, or `StopAll`. `A` is the sole display exception: an A source candle may retain its public Blue line even though that Blue is consumed for future calculation.

## 6. A — ACTIVE Bearish specification

### 6.1 Blue state, strict stops, and lifecycle consumption

A builds an immutable `BlueState` ledger from Blue calculation evidence. Blue formation remains exact: Scale Blue forms at its Reaction confirmation; Reset Blue uses the first strict lower-TF crossing of its broken level when available. Each Blue stop is the first strict Bearish crossing of its `source_extreme`; equality does not stop a Blue.

Accepted behavior source ownership adds a separate hard lifecycle rule: each accepted `A`, `S`, `E`, or `StopAll` source candle consumes every Blue whose source index is at or before that boundary for all later A formation. This is source-candle ownership, not decision-timestamp ownership. An A may use/retain a Blue on its own source candle while A is being formed and displayed, but immediately after that A is accepted the same Blue is no longer reusable. An accepted `S`, `E`, or `StopAll` source is excluded from Blue calculation state entirely.

### 6.2 Ordinary adjacent-Blue route

Ordinary A evaluates adjacent calculation-valid Blue states that remain newer than the active Blue-consumption boundary. A pair may trigger through the established direct or inherited-stop route. When the first Blue stopped before the second formed, continuation geometry is frozen over the owning interval; inherited-stop ownership uses the complete stop-candle through the aligned Reaction Break candle. Directional source selection is the maximum High and strict comparisons preserve chronology. Exact equal-event ties use deterministic ordering. Once an A is accepted, its source becomes the next hard Blue-consumption boundary: both Blues that formed it and every earlier Blue are unavailable to subsequent pairs. The previous current-Blue adjacent-reuse exception is superseded by this lifecycle rule.

### 6.3 Double-stop route

A Reset Blue marked calculation-invalid by the Blue double-stop rule can create the special A route with the previous valid Blue only when the previous Blue's first strict stop belongs to the invalid Reset Blue source candle. The route then requires the first qualifying same-direction canonical Reaction after the trigger chronology. A special route cannot duplicate a Reaction already owned by ordinary A, and earlier ordinary A lifecycle may suppress the special route when its first stop already completed before the special Reaction. The same hard Blue-consumption cutoff applies before and after special-route source selection; an invalid Reset Blue cannot revive a Blue consumed by an earlier accepted behavior.

### 6.4 Reaction confirmation and A source freeze

After a valid Blue-pair trigger, the first qualifying canonical Bearish Reaction confirms A. The A source/price is the maximum High from the trigger main-candle open through the exact lower-TF Reaction confirmation, inclusive. Prices later in the same Break candle are outside A ownership and cannot move the source retroactively. Ties retain the earliest source unless the owning helper explicitly states otherwise.

### 6.5 A stop and lifecycle handoff

A itself stops on the first strict Bearish crossing after its confirming Reaction. A historical stop before a route's `not_before` boundary belongs to the previous cycle; a later recross of the same level cannot be reinterpreted as the new cycle's first stop. The stop event opens S space. Once A is accepted, its source candle is immediately a hard Blue-consumption boundary for all later A calculation; retaining a same-source A+Blue public line does not retain Blue calculation eligibility.

## 7. S — ACTIVE Bearish specification

### 7.1 General A→S gate

Only A candidates outside an already-owned S continuation are eligible. S begins at A's first strict Bearish stop. If the next A confirmation is already reached at/before that handoff, the stale A does not open S. The detector audits the stopped A's first physical Order_A independently before choosing the S route.

A decided S normally owns subsequent A continuation. In addition, every accepted S source candle is a hard Blue-consumption boundary: all Blue sources at or before the S source are unavailable to every later A, irrespective of the later S decision timestamp, and the S source candle itself cannot be Blue. A later A may therefore use only Blue sources strictly newer than the accepted S source boundary. Existing Reset/Reset preemption geometry remains valid only inside that post-boundary Blue population.

### 7.2 Order-free Type-3 S Blue

Type-3 is an opposite-Reset-leg route available after A stop and before the first Order deadline. The opposite Reaction owning the Reset must have confirmed by the A-stop event and must not already have Reset before that A stop. Candidate geometry spans the **complete opposite Reaction Break main candle through the Reset main candle**, inclusive, and selects the maximum High with **last-candle ownership on equality**. After Reset, the first strict Bearish cross of that candidate wins only if at least one ordinary same-direction Reaction confirms after A stop and no later than the cross. Earliest valid Type-3 decision wins.

### 7.3 Order-free Type-4 S Blue

Type-4 is the same-direction Reaction continuation available after A stop only while no opposite Order has formed. For every aligned Bearish Reaction confirmed before the Order deadline, candidate geometry spans the A-stop main candle through that Reaction Break main candle, inclusive, selects the maximum High and assigns equality to the **last** candidate candle. Search begins at the maximum of A-stop event, aligned Reaction confirmation and candidate formation event. That lower-timeframe start is inclusive. The next aligned Reaction confirmation and Order deadline are exclusive upper bounds. The first strict Bearish cross creates S Blue only when a public calculation-valid Blue formed from the candidate source through that cross. If a candidate crosses without qualifying Blue, no S is created from it; the next aligned Reaction rebuilds a fresh candidate from the same A-stop origin.

Type-3 and Type-4 are independent. Earlier exact decision event wins; Type-3 owns only a true exact-event tie.

### 7.4 Order-backed Simple and Advanced routes

The first physical opposite Order_A owned by the stopped A is immutable for that A; later native Reactions do not refresh it merely because they are newer. Candidate timing first applies established price geometry. Exact event chronology may reclassify an apparent after-Order Simple candidate as pre-Order only when its candidate event is strictly before Order First; equality belongs to after-Order. A valid nested same-direction Reaction wholly contained in the physical opposite Order, with aligned confirmation at or before Order confirmation, owns the **Advanced** path and cannot be stolen by the pre-Order Simple chronology optimization.

For pre-Order Simple, candidate geometry spans A-stop through Order First with the A-stop candle restricted to lower-TF prices at/after the exact A-stop event. For post-Order Simple, the first aligned Reaction after Order confirmation is used and candidate geometry spans Order Break through aligned Reaction Break inclusive with last-on-equality ownership. Advanced uses the directionally relevant opposite Order box source after a nested aligned Reaction confirms.

### 7.5 S decision race

After Order confirmation, two strict lower-TF events compete:

- physical Order stop: `Low < OrderStop` → **S Red**;
- S candidate strict Bearish cross → **S Blue** only after an aligned Reset Blue formation or an ordinary aligned Reaction completion qualifies the candidate.

An exact same lower-TF position for both crossings produces no decision. Otherwise the earlier event wins. The legacy pre-Order Simple fallback may initially observe an unqualified candidate cross; if later qualification exists by that exact event it becomes Blue, otherwise the fallback path is rebuilt through normal ownership rather than inventing a family.

When a Red decision wins, Red source geometry is recalculated from Order Break through the Red decision main candle unless the accepted pre-Order source is itself authoritative.

### 7.6 Shared accepted-Order stop reconciliation

After E/OrderAudit accepts physical Orders, an open S may be converted to Red by **any** accepted physical Order whose strict stop occurs at or after the frozen S source main-candle start and strictly before S's current decision; the Order confirmation must be strictly earlier than its stop. Parent identity is irrelevant to use; physical identity is authoritative. Candidates are deduplicated by `(FirstIndex, BreakIndex)`, ordered by `(stopCrossEvent, confirmation, FirstIndex, BreakIndex)`, and provenance remains attached to the Order that created it.

## 8. E — ACTIVE Bearish specification

### 8.1 Parent stop and E-space opening

Every E cycle starts only after the first strict Bearish stop of an accepted S/E parent. For an E parent, a stop search begins at its decision event, so E cannot stop before the Order-stop event that confirmed it. Sequence/StopAll boundaries may later reinterpret parent type, but do not invent a different price event.

### 8.2 Physical Order choices

At each parent stop, E considers physical Orders from these routes: direct parent-stop Order_A, an S-carried unconsumed Order, a gate-owned initial A Order, carried-live accepted identity, post-stop accepted-live identity, and accepted Order_B reset-leg identities. `parent-stop` and `reset-leg` are creation causes; `carried-live` / `accepted-live` are use routes only. A candidate must possess an exact strict Order stop. Winner is earliest stop event; for an exact same stop event the larger Order First index wins (`-FirstIndex` tie key). Sequence reset boundaries may invalidate an Order crossing that would span a hard reset.

### 8.3 E source and decision

`decision_event = max(parent_stop_event, order_stop_event)`. The E source is the maximum High across the **complete main candle containing the parent stop through the complete main candle containing the Order stop**, inclusive. Lower-TF chronology decides whether stops occurred; it does not truncate either E boundary candle's OHLC. Strict-better replacement retains the earliest equal source.

### 8.4 Recursive family/number lifecycle

Every fully formed accepted S starts a provisional E1 chain in S color. Recursive children are built after the preceding E's strict stop. Reconciliation is chronological: a stopped E leaves the active set but remains historical output. Family follows the accepted stopped parent. Red family outranks Blue at a shared physical source; within equal behavioral priority exact decision chronology is the tie-breaker. When stopped members of the same accepted family exist, the next number is `max(stopped family number)+1`; otherwise the family starts at 1. An active Red E cannot be superseded by S; a Red S may supersede a Blue E under the source lifecycle rules, while Blue S cannot steal an active E continuation.

### 8.5 Consumed S evidence and independent roots

A suppressed/non-public S can remain calculation evidence for continuation of a stopped larger E when lifecycle ownership proves it belongs to that continuation. Its first E inherits the stopped larger E's reconciled family and next number, then recursive children are rebuilt natively. Separately, each accepted stopped S may retain an independent direct E1 root. A same-source accepted E owns that physical source and prevents a provisional S at that source from manufacturing a competing later root. Explicitly invalid S evidence cannot create cross-family competing root provenance when native E continuation already owns the source.

### 8.6 Same-source reconciliation and OrderAudit rebuild

At one physical E source, Red E outranks Blue E; within the same family higher number wins; exact remaining ties preserve the earlier accepted object. After reconciliation, the canonical Order ledger is rebuilt from the accepted E state. Valid parent-stop Order_A identities are retained even if later visibility changes their consuming owner. External restoration/continuation replacement must resynchronize OrderAudit before serialization. Every accepted E source is also a hard Blue-consumption boundary and may not publish or participate as a same-source Blue; later A may use only Blue sources strictly newer than that E source.

## 9. Order_A — ACTIVE canonical physical parent-stop rule

### 9.1 Creation gate

Order_A is the physical `parent-stop` route opened by an accepted strict behavior stop. A bounded/direct geometry candidate may create Order_A **only** when its `(FirstIndex, BreakIndex)` exists in the canonical opposite-direction (Bullish) Reaction stream. Geometry absent from that canonical registry remains internal evidence and cannot enter OrderAudit as Order_A or receive a synthetic reaction number.

After a stopped A, the first canonical opposite Order is immutable for that A. For S/E parent stops, direct bounded geometry may be evaluated, but canonical membership remains mandatory. One exact parent-stop cause may own at most one physical Order_A; when multiple candidates compete, earliest canonical confirmation, then FirstIndex, then BreakIndex owns the cause.

### 9.2 Canonical stop

Order stop provenance comes from `MarketChronology.canonical_order_stop`. For Mode A it uses the canonical leg-head/floor context required by that opposite Reaction; for Mode B it uses the previous healthy opposite Reaction's outer edge under the established chronology. The Order's exact strict stop uses the **opposite direction** predicate; for this Bearish calculation that is `Low < OrderStop`. Equality does not stop an Order.

### 9.3 Parent validity and retention

An S explicitly identified in invalid_s_root_identities is calculation evidence, not an accepted S parent, and cannot create or retain a `parent-stop` Order_A cause. Once a valid canonical Order_A enters the identity-keyed ledger, later E/lifecycle reconciliation may change who uses it but cannot delete that physical identity/provenance. A shared Order_B identity may add reset-leg provenance without erasing valid parent-stop provenance.

## 10. Order_B — ACTIVE Bearish reset-leg rule

### 10.1 Eligibility and post-stop owner

Order_B is eligible only after an accepted lifecycle stop (`A`, `S`, `E`, or `StopAll`) selected by the accepted lifecycle owner of the stopped main candle. The stop opens eligibility; it is **not** the geometric HH anchor.

### 10.2 Geometric behavior anchor

For each reset Bearish Reaction, choose the latest accepted behavior source that exists strictly before the Reaction FirstGreen candle, independent of current dominance. Valid anchor families are A/S/E/StopAll. When several lifecycle projections share exactly one source candle, lifecycle priority and number resolve only that exact-source tie.

### 10.3 HH construction and extension

Use the closed main-candle range from anchor behavior source through reset Reaction FirstGreen, inclusive:

`HH = maximum High(anchor candle .. reset Reaction FirstGreen)`

Only a strict better High replaces the current source, so equal extremes retain the earliest source. The HH source must be strictly before the reset Reaction FirstGreen. It must also extend beyond the anchor itself: the HH must be strictly above the anchor behavior `High`; equality invalidates the setup.

### 10.4 Reset and strict break

The reset Reaction must first produce its canonical Reset. Search **strictly after** that exact Reset event for the first lower-TF `High > HH`. Equality is not a break. This exact lower-TF timestamp is `strict_break_time`.

### 10.5 Accepted-A expiry

Let the next accepted A formation after the reset Reaction First be `A_next`. If `A_next <= strict_break_time`, the pending reset leg expires. A is upstream of Order_B feedback, so this hard expiry prevents a stale S/E/StopAll setup from firing inside a newer A lifecycle.

### 10.6 Physical canonical opposite Reaction

After the strict break, choose the first canonical Bullish Reaction satisfying both:

`strict_break_time <= FirstTime`

`strict_break_time < ConfirmationTime`

Thus **FirstTime equality is valid**, while the price break and confirmation remain strict. Canonical-Reaction membership is mandatory; geometry-only evidence cannot become Order_B.

### 10.7 Provenance and identity

Order_B records post-stop behavior, geometric anchor type/source/extreme, reset Reaction identity/confirmation, Reset index/broken level/time, frozen HH boundary/source, exact strict break, and final physical opposite Reaction identity/confirmation. Physical Order identity remains `(FirstIndex, BreakIndex)`. Multiple reset-leg causes may merge into one identity; they do not create duplicate physical Orders.

## 11. Order / OrderAudit architecture

1. The identity-keyed Order ledger is canonical; parent labels are provenance, not identity.
2. Creation causes are exactly `parent-stop` (Order_A) and `reset-leg` (Order_B). `carried-live` and `accepted-live` are consumption/use routes.
3. One exact parent-stop event has one physical Order_A owner. Cause deduplication ranks by confirmation, FirstIndex, BreakIndex.
4. `prepare_order_audit` merges S-stage and E-stage accepted ledgers, retains identities outside the presentation range when required by a visible behavior, deduplicates causes, and computes a strict stop only when it was not already authoritative.
5. `accepted_audit_entry` filters an A-owned identity to accepted A provenance without discarding the complete physical cause set used for presentation.
6. OrderAudit must not fabricate parentage: invalid/suppressed parents lose creation rights; valid historical parent-stop provenance survives later consumer reconciliation.
7. The active physical Order routes are Order_A and Order_B.

## 12. Lifecycle / StopAll — ACTIVE specification

### 12.1 Shared priority and directional invariance

Lifecycle family semantics are direction-invariant. The cross-stage priority is exactly:

`StopAll > E Red > S Red > E Blue > S Blue > A`

Within a stage/family, accepted number/source chronology supplies deterministic ties. Directional price movement enters only through the strict Bearish stop predicate.

### 12.2 Dominant S/E sequence state

Accepted S/E objects remain valid output even when lower priority prevents them from replacing current dominant sequence ownership. Repeated exact dominant S color or exact E `(family, number)` increments its occurrence count. A higher-priority incoming behavior replaces lower dominant state. For E within equal family priority, a larger same-family number advances the dominant E group; Red E dominates Blue E.

### 12.3 E-driven StopAll

If an existing active StopAll is strictly stopped before/equal to an incoming E decision, the incoming E constructs the next numbered StopAll and the stopped active StopAll leaves current active ownership. Separately, when the current dominant S or exact E group has at least two accepted occurrences and its owning behavior strictly stops at or before the incoming E decision, that E becomes `StopAll1` through the `sequence-group-stop` gate. The incoming E supplies the physical Order/provenance; its family need not equal the stopped group.

### 12.4 Exact Blue-repeat reversal gate

Blue-repeat evidence is **accepted-occurrence counting**, independent of dominant-owner transitions, except for the explicit dominant S-Red continuation rule below:

- all S Blue occurrences share exact key `S` regardless of S subtype;
- every numbered E Blue has its own key: `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, ...;
- different E numbers never add together;
- a key qualifies only at count `>= 2`;
- the incoming reversal must be an accepted **S Red with native Mode-B formation Order**;
- among qualified keys, the latest accepted qualifying occurrence owns deterministic metadata;
- any accepted Red S, accepted Red E, or hard StopAll boundary clears prior Blue-repeat evidence, so stale Blue evidence cannot be consumed later;
- **dominant S-Red continuation exception:** if current dominant sequence ownership is already `S Red` with `s_count >= 2`, an incoming S Red is counted as the next occurrence of that same dominant group and is **not** promoted by `opposite-s-group-stop`, regardless of lower-priority pending Blue-repeat evidence. If that continued S-Red group later strictly stops at/before an incoming E decision, Section 12.3 may create `StopAll1` through `sequence-group-stop`.

Outside that continuation exception, a qualifying S Red is promoted to fresh `StopAll1` through `opposite-s-group-stop`. This rule changes neither `SEQUENCE_PRIORITY` nor calculation-stage order. S/Red/Blue labels are not direction-mirrored.

### 12.5 Hard StopAll boundary

StopAll is a hard historical boundary. Once decided from already-reconciled chronology, future state cannot retroactively remove or move that prefix boundary. Creation resets active sequence keys/counts, dominant owners and pending Blue-repeat evidence. Historical StopAll objects remain output; only current-cycle ownership resets. E receives the accepted StopAll source map through an atomic sequence-reset publication: the sorted boundary index is refreshed and candidate/carried context caches are invalidated once, while immutable physical crossing/stop caches and historical accepted causes remain retained. For downstream audit semantics, but StopAll reconciliation does not rebuild past E from future reset state. A StopAll source is simultaneously a hard Blue-consumption boundary: every Blue at or before that source is unavailable to later A, and the StopAll source candle itself can never publish or participate as Blue.

### 12.6 Cross-stage A/S/E visibility ownership

A, S and E calculations continue to retain internal historical evidence. Public ownership is resolved from exact strict stops, source chronology and shared priority. A source that strictly extends beyond the newest stopped owner can be consumed as the closed owner's next leg head instead of re-entering as equal/smaller behavior; equality stays with the earlier owner. S under a stopped larger owner obeys analogous chronology-first ownership; a higher-priority Red S may supersede a stopped Blue S, while equal/lower candidates remain owned by the prior lifecycle. Final E/StopAll source occupancy removes duplicate A/S labels on the same physical source, while referenced historical parents are retained for lineage closure. Final Blue projection follows the same source ownership: `S/E/StopAll` source occupancy suppresses a same-source Blue line, while A is the sole permitted same-candle `A+Blue` display combination. That A display exception never restores the Blue to future calculation.

## 13. Serialization / API contract

### 13.1 Projection rule

Legacy serialization contains no trading recalculation. Decimal prices are stringified; native local datetimes are converted through the existing Tehran-local epoch contract. Stable source ordering is preserved. Presentation range filtering is applied after full calculation, and OrderAudit may retain a pre-range physical identity when an in-range public behavior references it. `calculationValid` is emitted as `true` for public A/S because invalid calculation objects have already been removed by the calculation/visibility owner.

### 13.2 Legacy JSON fields

### 13.3 Response envelope

The envelope contains `engine`, `version`, `pipelineVersion`, `blueLineVersion`, `aVersion`, `sVersion`, `eVersion`, `stopAllVersion`, enablement booleans, `timeframe`, `actualFrom`, `actualTo`, `directions`, and runtime `timings`. Each requested direction owns its own Reaction/Reset/Blue/A/S/E/StopAll/OrderAudit arrays.

### 13.4 Optional Bridge Output

`--bridge-output` adds a read-only projection built only from finalized calculation selections and canonical OrderAudit. It may validate a recorded strict event, but it must not search for a substitute trading event or mutate detector/lifecycle state. Physical Order joins use `(FirstIndex, BreakIndex)` and exact accepted causes, never list position.

### 13.5 Complete Source symbol and schema coverage

This inventory comes from the current Production AST after complete semantic review. AST addresses identify Source; they do not substitute for semantic validation. Package markers are retained for exact reconstruction; the production dynamic loader is the supported import surface.

## 14. Verification scope for the current release

Verification status for this behavioral revision:

- **PASS — syntax/compile:** every current Python module compiles successfully.
- **PASS — authoritative corrected case:** `FXCM:USOIL`, 30-second main timeframe, complete supplied 5-second RAW `2026-09-28 20:44:00` through `2026-09-29 11:45:55`, both directions. Bullish `2026-09-29 05:30:30` remains `S Red`; after its strict stop, `2026-09-29 05:53:00` becomes `StopAll1` through `sequence-group-stop` with dominant `S Red ×3`; `2026-09-29 11:09:30` becomes `StopAll2`. Bearish output is unchanged.
- **PASS — prior XAUUSD 1-second regression:** complete supplied `FOREXCOM:XAUUSD` 1-second RAW `2026-09-03 19:05:40` through `2026-09-08 03:18:28`, 30s, both directions. `Reaction/Reset/Blue/A/S/E/StopAll/OrderAudit` outputs are exact semantic matches to `5.4.20`.
- **PASS — prior USOIL regression #1:** complete supplied 5-second RAW `2026-09-08 07:23:20` through `2026-09-12 00:14:55`, 30s, both directions. All final output families are exact semantic matches to `5.4.20`.
- **PASS — prior USOIL regression #2:** complete supplied 5-second RAW `2026-09-11 02:53:30` through `2026-09-15 11:03:45`, 30s, both directions. All final output families are exact semantic matches to `5.4.20`.
- **PASS — prior XAUUSD 5-second reviewed-window regression:** immutable physical slice from the supplied Aug-25..Sep-23 RAW through `2026-09-03 23:59:55`, 30s Bearish, preserves exact `Reaction/Reset/Blue/A/S/E/StopAll/OrderAudit` output relative to `5.4.20`.
- **INCOMPLETE — full Aug-25..Sep-23 XAUUSD 5-second end-to-end comparison:** the full month-scale run exceeded the available single-command execution ceiling; no PASS is claimed for that supplemental full-history dataset.

The change is direction-invariant and resides only in shared lifecycle/StopAll arbitration. RAW inputs were not modified. Because one supplemental month-scale full-history regression remains incomplete, the release status is `REGRESSION NOT VERIFIED` under the project release gate despite all completed target and historical regression checks passing.

## 15. Current revision record

### `5.4.21` — ACTIVE

This bug fix corrects StopAll arbitration for a repeated dominant S-Red continuation. Once dominant `S Red` already has accepted count `>= 2`, a later S Red continues that same dominant group and lower-priority pending Blue-repeat evidence cannot preempt the S itself into `StopAll1`. The continued S is counted normally. If it later strictly stops before/equal to an incoming E decision, the established E-driven `sequence-group-stop` rule creates `StopAll1`. The cross-stage priority table and the `A → S → E → StopAll` calculation order are unchanged.

### `5.4.20` — HISTORICAL / SUPERSEDED

The previous synchronized release established hard Blue-consumption boundaries and the A display exception. Those rules remain incorporated unchanged. Its StopAll reversal gate could still promote an incoming S Red even when that S was the continuation of an already repeated dominant S-Red group; `5.4.21` supersedes only that arbitration detail.

        group since the latest accepted Red or StopAll boundary.  The repeated
        group need not remain the current dominant owner.  Directional mirroring is handled
        by strict stop/reaction geometry; Red/Blue family
        labels themselves are invariant.  Type-3 S Blue has no formation
        Order, so StopAll Order provenance remains optional.
